These ara the benefits to using an abstract class:
Code to be shared.
Default behaviour in methods, but want users of your class to be able to override it.
A class can implement any number of interfaces but a subclass can at most use only one abstract class.
An abstract class can have non-abstract Methods(concrete methods).	
An abstract class can declare or use any variables.
An abstract class can have constructor declaration.
An abstract Class is allowed to have all access modifiers for all of its member declaration.
